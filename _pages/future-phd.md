I am currently seeking talented and motivated PhD students—both domestic and international—with outstanding academic records. If you are passionate about research and interested in working with me, I encourage you to reach out via email. Please include your CV and a brief statement explaining why you would like to pursue a PhD under my supervision. My research interests are reflected in my publication list, which can help you determine alignment with your own goals and expertise.
